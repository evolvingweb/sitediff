SiteDiff makes it easy to see how a website changes. It can compare two similar sites against each other, or it can show how a single site changed over time. It is a useful tool for conducting QA on re-deployments, site upgrades, and more!

Each time you run SiteDiff, it produces an HTML report showing each requested path, and whether it has changed or not. For changed paths, you can see a colorized diff of the changes, or compare the visual differences side-by-side in a browser.

SiteDiff supports a range of normalization/sanitization rules. These allow you to eliminate spurious differences, narrowing down the differences to the ones that materially affect the site.

## Installation

You'll need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) 1.9.3 or higher. To speed things up, we first recommend installing _nokogiri_ and certain dependencies manually. The following works on Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y ruby-dev libz-dev gcc patch make
sudo apt-get install -y libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
sudo gem install nokogiri --no-rdoc --no-ri -- --use-system-libraries=true --with-xml2-include=/usr/include/libxml2
```
Then install sitediff:

```sudo gem install sitediff```

## User's guide

### Getting started

To track changes over time using SiteDiff, create a configuration for your site:

```sitediff init http://mysite.example.com```

SiteDiff will crawl your site, finding pages and caching their contents. You can open the configuration file ```sitediff/sitediff.yaml``` to see what SiteDiff found. See [the configuration reference](#configuration) for details on the contents of that file, and how you might want to alter it.

Now, you can make alterations to your site. For example, try upgrading any frameworks that your site uses. After you're done, check what actually changed:

```sitediff diff```

For each page, SiteDiff will report whether it did or did not change. For pages that changed, it will display a diff. If you want a nicer view of the changes, run SiteDiff's web report:

```sitediff serve```

SiteDiff will start an internal web server and open a report page on your browser. For each page, you can see the diff and a side-by-side view of the old and new versions.

You can now see if the changes were as you expected, or if some things didn't quite work out as you hoped. If you noticed unexpected changes, congratulations: SiteDiff just helped you find a bug you would have missed otherwise!

---

As you fix any issues, you can continue to alter your site and run ```sitediff diff``` to check the changes against the old version. Once you're satisfied with the state of your site, you can inform SiteDiff that it should re-cache your site:

```sitediff store```

The next time you run ``sitediff diff``, it will use this new version as the baseline for comparison.

Happy diffing!

### Comparing multiple sites

Sometimes you have two sites that you want to compare, for example a production site hosted on a public server and a development site hosted on your computer. SiteDiff can handle this situation, too! Just inform SiteDiff that there are two sites to compare:

```sitediff init http://mysite.example.com http://localhost/mysite```

Then when you run ```sitediff diff```, it will compare the cached version of the first site with the current version of the second site.

If both the first and second sites may be changing, you should tell SiteDiff not to cache either site:

```sitediff diff --cached=none```

### Preventing spurious diffs

Sometimes sites have spurious differences, that you don't want to show up in a comparison. For example, many sites protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery using a [semi-random token](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery#Synchronizer_token_pattern). Since this token changes on each HTTP GET, you probably don't care about such a change.

To help with issues such as this, SiteDiff allows you to normalize the HTML it fetches as it compares pages. In the ```sitediff.yaml``` configuration file, you can add "sanitization rules", which specify either DOM transformations or regular expression substitutions.

Here's an example of a rule you might add to remove Django CSRF-protection tokens:

```yaml
dom_transform:
  - title: Remove CSRF tokens
    type: remove
    selector: input[name=csrfmiddlewaretoken]
```

When you run ```sitediff init```, SiteDiff will even auto-detect some potentially useful rules, and include them in your configuration file. They start disabled, but you can easily remove the ```disabled: true``` line to try them out. Currently only rules useful for common Drupal sites are auto-detected.

See the [configuration file reference](#configuration) for more details.

### Getting help

SiteDiff has built-in help! To see a list of commands:

```sitediff help```

To get help on the options for a particular command, eg: ```diff```:

```sitediff help diff```

### Tips & tricks

* **Finding configuration files**

  SiteDiff will attempt to auto-detect any nearby ```sitediff.yaml``` files. But if your ```sitediff.yaml``` is in an unusual place, you can force SiteDiff to change to that directory:

  ```sitediff diff -C some-directory```

  Or you can even specify a list of config files at the command-line:

  ```sitediff diff myconfig.yaml otherconfig.yaml ...```

* **Handling large configuration files**

  If your configuration file starts getting really big, SiteDiff lets you separate it out into multiple files. Just have one base file that includes other files:

  ```yaml
  includes:
    - sanitization.yaml
    - paths.yaml
  ```

  This allows you to separate your configuration into logically groups. For example, generic rules for your site could live in a `generic.yaml` file, while rules pertaining to a particular update you're conducting could live in `update-8.2.yaml`.

* **Specifying paths**

  When you run ```sitediff diff```, you can specify which pages to look at in several ways:

  1. The ```paths``` key in your configuration file.
  1. The option ```--paths /foo /bar ...```.

     If you're trying to fix one page in particular, specifying just that one path will make ```sitediff diff``` run quickly!
  1. The option ```--paths-file FILE``` with a newline-delimited text file.

     This is particularly useful when you're trying to eliminate all diffs. SiteDiff creates a file ```output/failures.txt``` containing all paths which had differences, so as you try to fix differences, you can run:

     ```sitediff diff --paths-file output/failures.txt```

* **Debugging rules**

  When a sanitization rule isn't working quite right for you, you might run ```sitediff diff``` many times over. If fetching all the pages is taking too long, try adding the option ```--cached=all```. This tells SiteDiff not to re-fetch the contente, but just compare the previously cached versionâ€”it's a lot faster!

* **Handling security**

  Often development or staging sites are protected by [HTTP Authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). SiteDiff allows you to specify a username and password, by using a URL like ```http://user:pass@example.com```.

* **Running inside containers**

  If you run SiteDiff inside a container or virtual machine, the URLs in its report might not work from your host, such as ```localhost```. You can fix this by using the ```--before-url-report``` and ```--after-url-report``` options, to tell SiteDiff to use a different URL in the report than the one it uses for fetching.

  For example, if you ran ```sitediff init http://mysite.com http://localhost``` inside a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) VM, you might then run something like:

  ```sitediff diff --after-url-report=http://vagrant:8080```

## Configuration

SiteDiff relies on a [YAML](http://yaml.org/) configuration file, usually called ```sitediff.yaml```. You can create a reasonable one using ```sitediff init```, but there are many useful things you may want to manually add or change.

The following ```sitediff.yaml``` keys are recognized by SiteDiff:

* **before_url** and **after_url**: The two base URLs to compare, for example:

  ```yaml
  before_url: http://example.com/subsite
  after_url: http://localhost:8080/subsite
  ```

  They can also be paths to directories on the local filesystem.

  The _after_url_ MUST provided either at the command-line or in the sitediff.yaml. If the _before_url_ is provided, SiteDiff will compare the two sites. Otherwise, it will compare the current version of the 'after' site with the stored version of that site, as created by ```sitediff init``` or ```sitediff store```.

* **paths**: The list of paths to check, rooted at the base URL. For example:

  ```yaml
  paths:
    - index.html
    - page.html
    - cgi-bin/test.cgi?param=value
  ```

  In the example above, SiteDiff would compare _`http://example.com/subsite/index.html`_ and _`http://localhost:8080/subsite/index.html`_, followed by _page.html_, and so on.

  The _paths_ MUST be provided either at the command-line or in the `sitediff.yaml` file.

* **selector**: Chooses the sections of HTML we wish to compare, if you don't want to compare the entire page. For example if you want to only compare breadcrumbs between your two sites, you might specify:

  ```yaml
  selector: '#breadcrumb'
  ```

* **before_url_report** and **after_url_report**: Changes how SiteDiff reports which URLs it is comparing, but don't change what it actually compares.

  Suppose you are serving your 'after' website on a virtual machine with IP 192.1.2.3, and you are also running SiteDiff inside that VM. To make links in the report accessible from outside the VM, you might provide

  ```yaml
  after_url: http://localhost
  after_url_report: http://192.1.2.3
  ```

* **sanitization**: A list of regular expression rules to normalize your HTML for comparison.

  Each rule should have a **pattern** regex, which is used to search the HTML. Each found instance is replaced with the provided **substitute**, or deleted if no substitute is provided.  A rule may also have a **selector**, which constrains it to operate only on HTML fragments which match that CSS selector.

  For example, forms on Drupal sites have a randomly generated `form_build_id` on form pages:

  ```html
  <input type="hidden" name="form_build_id" value="form-1cac6b5b6141a72b2382928249605fb1"/>
  ```

  We're not interested in comparing random content, so we could use the following rule to fix this:

  ```yaml
    sanitization:
    # Remove form build IDs
    - pattern: '<input type="hidden" name="form_build_id" value="form-[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+" *\/?>'
      selector: 'input'
      substitute: '<input type="hidden" name="form_build_id" value="__form_build_id__">'
   ```

  Sanitization rules may also have a **path** attribute, whose value is a regular expression. If present, the rule will only apply to matching paths.

* **dom_transform**: A list of transformations to apply to the HTML before comparing.

  This is similar to _sanitization_, but it applies transformations to the structure of the HTML, instead of to the text. Each transformation has a **type**, and potentially other attributes. The following types are available:

  * **remove**: Given a **selector**, removes all elements that match it.

  For example, say we have a block containing the current time, which is expected to change. To ignore that, we might choose to delete the block before comparison:

  ```yaml
    dom_transform:
    # Remove current time block
    - type: remove
    - selector: div#block-time
  ```

  * **unwrap**: Given a **selector**, replaces all matching elements with their children. For example, your content on one side of the comparison might look like this:

    ```html
    <p>This is some text</p>
    <img src="test.png"/>
    ```

	But on the other side, it might be wrapped in an `article` tag:
    ```html
    <article>
      <p>This is some text</p>
      <img src="test.png"/>
    </article>
    ```

    You could fix it with the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    dom_transform:
      - type: unwrap
        selector: article
    ```

  * **remove_class**: Given a **selector** and a **class**, removes that class from each element that matches the selector. It can also take a list of classes, instead of just one.

  For example, here are two sample rules for removing a single class and removing multiple classes from all `div` elements:

  ```yaml
  dom_transform:
    # Remove class foo from div elements
    - type: remove_class
      selector: div
      class: class-foo
    # Remove class bar and class baz from div elements
    - type: remove_class
      selector: div
      class:
        - class-bar
        - class-baz
  ```

  * **unwrap_root**: Replaces the entire root element with its children.

* **before** and **after**: Applies rules to just one side of the comparison.

  These blocks can contain any of the following sections: _selector_, _sanitization_,  _dom_transform_. Such a section placed in _before_ will be applied just to the _before_ side of the comparison, and similarly for _after_.

  For example, if you wanted to let different date formatting not create diff failures, you might use the following:

  ```yaml
  before:
    sanitization:
    - pattern: '[1-2][0-9]{3}/[0-1][0-9]/[0-9]{2}'
      substitute: '__date__'
  after:
    sanitization:
    - pattern:  '[A-Z][a-z]{2} [0-9]{1,2}(st|nd|rd|th) [1-2][0-9]{3}'
      substitute: '__date__'
  ```

   The above rule will replace dates of the form `2004/12/05` in _before_ and dates of
   the form `May 12th 2004` in _after_ with `__date__`.

* **includes**: The names of other configuration YAML files to merge with this one.

  ```yaml
  includes:
    - config/sanitize_domains.yaml
    - config/strip_css_js.yaml
  ```

### Samples

The `config` directory contains some example ```sitediff.yaml``` files. For example, [sitediff.yaml.example](config/sitediff.yaml.example).
